# nb-asr-paralleltext
Parallel text extraction and semantic alignment tools for Norwegian text.

This repository contains code and data for producing parallel text pairs using 
semantic similarity methods. The included scripts operate on sentence- and 
paragraph-level text and generate aligned pairs based on embedding similarity.

## Included Files

### Data
- **bible_aligned_embeddings.csv**  
  Sentence-level parallel text extracted using embedding similarity.  
  Contains original text, candidate match, similarity score, and metadata.

- **bible_aligned_embeddings_75.csv**  
  Same as above, but filtered with a stricter similarity threshold (0.75).

- **bible_parallel_paragraphs.csv**  
  Paragraph-level parallel text pairs generated by semantic comparison.

### Scripts
- **semantic_extract_1.py**  
  Extracts semantic sentence-level alignments using embeddings.  
  Computes similarities and exports aligned pairs to CSV.

- **semantic_extract_paragraph.py**  
  Computes paragraph-level semantic matches.  
  Designed for larger blocks of text where sentence boundaries differ.

- **similarity_sentences_with_number.py**  
  Computes similarity between numbered sentences and produces 
  alignment data including sentence IDs.

## Usage

Example sentence-level extraction:
```bash
python semantic_extract_1.py \
    --input text_source.txt \
    --reference text_target.txt \
    --output aligned.csv
